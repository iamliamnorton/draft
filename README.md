DraftKings, FanDuel, MoneyBall. Fantasy sports betting apps.

This is a Rails 4.2 app using Postgres. Far too many tests for a proof of concept.

These apps are essentially contest running applications, whereby users can create contests, pick their teams, then the results are calculated using real world statistics.
